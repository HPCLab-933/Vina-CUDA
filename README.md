# Vina-CUDA
In this project, we propose **Vina-CUDA** based on [Vina-GPU 2.1](https://github.com/DeltaGroupNJUPT/Vina-GPU-2.1), which aims to further enhance Vina-GPU 2.1's docking speed by optimizing its core algorithms through deep utilization of GPU hardware features, thereby reducing the cost of virtual screening and increasing the efficiency of drug design.
